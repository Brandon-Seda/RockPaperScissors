# RockPaperScissors
Title: Rock Paper Scissors

This project was created as part of The Odin Project lesson plan. Initially created with the use of the console but refractored for button more dynamic use.

Rock, paper, scissors is a simple game which can be played by 2 or more people. This project uses a computer as the second player and gives the player a chance to win five times before the computer reaches five wins. 


There was a slight difficulty working with DOM(Document Object Model) to create things such as my scoreboard, game display and button utilites. It was a great learning experience as it made the simple console project I once created into a more stylish and functional one. 
There is still a lot more work I could do with the project and will see to it!
